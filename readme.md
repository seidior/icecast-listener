## Icecast-Listener

This tool can listen to an Icecast server and display a notification if a stream starts. It does this by polling the server at a regular interval.

#### Requirements:

- curl (built-in to OS X)
- terminal-notifier (optional)

#### Usage:

./notify.sh (name of network)

Comes with [Relay.FM](https://relay.fm), [5by5](http://5by5.tv), [ATP](http://atp.fm), and [The Incomparable](https://theincomparable.com). Let me know if any others should be installed by default.
